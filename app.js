  - Pokemon 7: Squirtle evolves into Pokemon 8: Wartortle
  - Pokemon 25: Pikachu evolves into Pokemon 26: Raichu

More Hints: The existing starter Pokemon will be *replaced* in your party with the Pokemon it evolved into. When working with an array of objects, the splice() array method is ideal for replacing one element with another.

Exercise 10
1. Add a method called `catchPokemon` to the `game` object. This method should:
  - Accept an object as a parameter called `pokemonObj`

  - not return anything

After writing this method, call it and pass in a Pokemon object of your choice from the `pokemon` data to catch it.

Tips:
For this exercise, it's okay to have a negative number of pokeballs.
After updating the method, call it and pass in a Pokemon object of your choice from the `pokemon` data to catch it.
Also, log the `game.items` array to confirm that the pokeball quantity is being decremented.

/*
Exercise 13
1. Create a `gymStatus` method in `game` to tally completed and incomplete gyms.
2. How will you iterate through the `gyms` array and update the tally? Remember to log the final tally.
This method should:
  - Not accept any arguments.
  - Initially create a constant `gymTally`, which is an object that has two
    properties: `completed` and `incomplete`, both of which are initially set to 0.
  - Iterate through the objects in the `game.gyms` array and update the
    properties on `gymTally` as follows:
    - `completed` should count how many gyms in the array have a value of `true`
      for their `completed` property.
    - `incomplete` should count how many gyms in the array have a value of
      `false` for their `completed` property.
  - Log the value of `gymTally`.
  - The method should not return anything.
For example, if five gym objects have a value of `true` on their `completed` property and
three gym objects have a value of `false` on their `completed` property, the logged value would be:
`{ completed: 5, incomplete: 3 }`.

Exercise 18
Add a new property to the `game` object called `collection` and initialize its value to an empty array.

  - Ensure that no more than six Pokemon can be in the party at any time. 
    Excess Pokemon should be placed in the `game.collection` array.
  - It's up to you how to distribute Pokemon in a situation where more than six 
    would be placed into the `game.party` array.

Again, for this exercise, it's okay to have a negative number of pokeballs.

After updating the method, use it by calling it and passing in a pokemon object of your choice from the `pokemon` data to catch it.

Also, log the `game.items` array to confirm that the pokeball quantity is being decremented.
